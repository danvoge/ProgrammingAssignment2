## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special matrix which really is a list containg a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
      get <- function() x
      setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
      getsolve <- function() m
      list(set = set, get = get,
           setsolve = setsolve,
           getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Inverts the matrix but first checks to see if it has been done already


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
