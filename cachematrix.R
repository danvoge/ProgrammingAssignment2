## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special matrix which really is a list containg a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
print ("hello")
}


## Inverts the matrix but first checks to see if it has been done already


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  print ("hello")
}
